# Atlanta Movie
The Atlanta Movie Project is a simple CRUD application built for final project of Georgia Tech's CS 4400 Intro to Database Systems Course.

This course provides students with an introduction to database design and use, and requires students to develop their own application beginning from a set of project requirements, creating an entity relationship diagram and relational schema from those requirements, and creating a full stack application from the diagram and schema.

The Atlanta Movie application is an online system for managing users, theaters, and movies in an application similar to Fandango. Users can register as customers, theater managers, or both. System admins are responsible for creating new theaters, movies, and managing users.
